## Project Description
Our food truck app startup aims to tackle several key challenges in the industry

## The Problem statement
Our food truck app startup aims to tackle several key challenges in the industry. Many food trucks struggle with discoverability due to their changing locations and lack of visibility, making it hard for customers to find them in real-time. Additionally, food truck owners lack effective ways to engage with customers, communicate their current locations, menu updates, wait times, or special promotions. This leads to long wait times, ordering frustrations, and lost sales. Furthermore, food truck operators face inconsistent revenue due to unpredictable foot traffic, weather conditions, and difficulties in optimizing their locations for maximum profit. To top it off, customers expect multiple payment methods and loyalty rewards, but food trucks often have limited capabilities to offer digital transactions and incentives. Our app seeks to address these pain points and revolutionize the food truck industry.

## The Solution
1. Real-time Location Tracking: Allow customers to find food trucks in real-time, using GPS and mapping technology.
2. Digital Menu and Ordering: Provide a digital menu and ordering system, enabling customers to place orders and pay online.
3. Push Notifications and Updates: Enable food truck owners to send push notifications and updates to customers about their location, menu, wait times, and promotions.
5. Multiple Payment Options: Offer various payment options, including credit/debit cards, mobile payments, and digital wallets.
7. Customer Feedback and Ratings: Allow customers to provide feedback and ratings, helping food truck owners improve their service and quality.
